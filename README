ctest is a unit test framework for software written in C.
It features:
- adding tests with minimal hassle
- supports suites of tests
- supports setup()  teardown() per test
- output format not messed up when tests fail, so easy to parse.
- displays elapsed time, so you can keep your tests fast
- uses coloring for easy error recognition

example test:
CTEST(suite, test1) {
    ASSERT_STR("foo", "foo");
}

CTEST(suite, test2) {
    ASSERT_EQUAL(1, 2);
}

NO further typing is needed! ctest does the rest.

example output when running ctest:
$ ./test
TEST 1/2 suite1:test1 [OK]
TEST 2/2 suite1:test2 [FAIL]
  ERR: mytests.c:4  expected 1, got 2
RESULTS: 2 tests,  1 ok, 1 failed
Elapsed time: 1 ms
